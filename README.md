This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dockerfiles: the lack of explicit Python version specification and potential dependency problems. The original `Dockerfile` uses `alpine:latest`, which can change unexpectedly, causing build inconsistencies.  It also omits explicit python version, leading to further issues. The `Dockerfile_solution.txt` provides a corrected version that uses a specific alpine version and installs a specific python version, avoiding these potential problems. The solution also ensures all dependencies are explicitly listed and installed.
